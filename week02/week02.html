                        This course is an introduction to the process of using
                        machine learning to mine knowledge and patterns from data.
                        Students will be introduced to several different algorithms
                        spanning both supervised and unsupervised learning, and
                        learn how to appropriately apply them in data mining. This
                        course will examine methods that have emerged and proven to
                        be of value in recognizing patterns and making predictions
                        from an applications perspective. This course will survey
                        applications and provide an opportunity for hands-on
                        experimentation with algorithms for data mining using
                        easy-to-use software and cases.
