        <h1>Add Search bar to top right corner</h1>

            Although currently this content of this site doesn't require a search
            bar, and I currently lack the knowledge of how to implement a search
            bar, as the site grows more and more the ability to search through
            content and find projects or business information would be valuable to
            a customer.

        <h1> Moved contact information to footer bar </h1>

            Previously I was unaware of where to position my contact information.
            I saw the footer as a place more as a place to but copyright information
            about the website; however, I was incorrect. I read from the reading the
            a prime spot to put your contact information is in the footer, and
            because I don't have any copyright information currently, this is much
            better than what I previously had.

        <h1>Changed contact information from static text to interactive links</h1>

        <p>
            The reading stated "Guiding Interaction" was key to good web application
            design. One thing that I felt helped along in that effort was changing
            the static text of the contact information to interactive links. Instead
            of having to copy and paste contact information, it now opens a link
            using their email to handle contacting us.
        </p>
        <h1>Added comment feature in "About Us" section</h1>
        <p>
            Though there wasn't much of a design problem to this, I was lacking
            this requirement from last week, and felt that now would be a good
            opportunity to add some more interaction into my business website.
            This has no functionality yet, but stay tuned.
