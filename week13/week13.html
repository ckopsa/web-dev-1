      <h1>Angular Framework</h1>
      <p>
The features of the Angular Framework that I was demonstrating in this demo, was
the ease of connecting with other popular technologies (Firebase), how a single
page application can act like a several page application through routing, and
how easy it is to make an application look good with angular material from
Google. This took me a lot longer than 5 hours (closer to 10), but I had a lot
of fun, and want to make a cross-platform application to handle the
administration of home teaching. I felt like this was a good opportunity to get
started on that.
